## Quantum Computing Research Project Completed

### Objective
Conducted focused research investigation on quantum computing developments from 2023-2024.

### Agent Capabilities Demonstrated
1. ✅ **Self-expanding capabilities** - Created custom `quantum_research_tool` for specialized data extraction
2. ✅ **Multi-source research** - Retrieved data from IBM, Google, NIST, and industry sources
3. ✅ **Multi-model functionality** - Used recursive thinking tool for deep analysis
4. ✅ **Persistent storage** - Saved comprehensive report to ~/research/quantum_computing_report_2023_2024.md

### Key Research Findings
- Google Willow: First "below threshold" quantum error correction (paradigm-shifting)
- IBM Condor: 1,121 qubits, IBM Heron: 133 qubits with 3-5x improvement
- NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography: 3 standards finalized (FIPS 203, 204, 205)
- Industry revenue exceeded $1.45B in 2024

### Sources Consulted
- IBM Quantum Computing Blog
- Google Quantum AI Blog
- NIST Official Announcements
- The Quantum Insider
- McKinsey Technology Reports

### Files Created
- ~/tools/quantum_research_tool.py (custom research tool)
- ~/research/quantum_computing_report_2023_2024.md (comprehensive report)
