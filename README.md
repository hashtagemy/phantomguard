## 🎯 The Problem

AI agents are complex and unpredictable:
- Get stuck in infinite loops
- Drift away from their task
- Have missing dependencies or tools
- Leak sensitive data
- Execute malicious commands
- Hallucinate results
- In multi-agent pipelines: silently diverge from the original goal as tasks are handed off

You need to test, analyze, and monitor them before and during execution.

---

## 💡 The Solution

Norn provides a complete platform for agent testing and monitoring:

### 1. Import & Analyze
Import agents from GitHub or ZIP files. Norn automatically:
- Discovers tools, functions, and dependencies
- Detects missing packages and installs them
- Identifies potential issues (security, credentials, missing tools)
- Generates a smart test task tailored to the agent's actual capabilities

### 2. Run & Monitor
Execute agents directly from the dashboard with real-time monitoring:
- Live WebSocket updates during execution
- Step-by-step tool call tracking with relevance and security scoring
- Issue detection and alerts
- Automatic loop and drift detection

### 3. Workspace Isolation
Each agent run gets its own isolated working directory:
- Output files (databases, logs, results) go to `norn_logs/workspace/{session_id}/` — not the project root
- Agents receive the `NORN_WORKSPACE` env var pointing to their directory
- Clean separation between runs; no cross-contamination

### 4. Swarm Monitoring *(multi-agent pipelines)*
Monitor chains of agents that work together as a swarm:
- Group sessions by `swarm_id` — see the full pipeline at a glance
- **Alignment score**: measures how closely each agent's task aligns with the first agent's intent
- Per-agent quality, efficiency, and security scores in pipeline order
- Spot where a multi-agent chain starts drifting off-goal

### 5. Review & Improve
Comprehensive session reports with:
- Task completion analysis
- Efficiency and security scores
- Per-tool usage analysis (correct / incorrect / unnecessary)
- Agent decision-making observations
- AI-powered recommendations via Amazon Nova

### 6. Browser Audit *(requires Nova Act API key)*
Shadow browser verification powered by Nova Act:
- Automatically visits URLs accessed by agents
- Verifies that web content matches expected results
- Detects prompt injection attacks embedded in web pages
- Enable: `pip install -e ".[browser]"` + set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` in `.env`

**Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite · FastAPI + Python 3.10+ · WebSocket

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Agent Import & Discovery
- Import agents from GitHub (with subfolder support) or ZIP files
- AST-based code analysis discovers tools, functions, dependencies, and entry points
- Automatic dependency installation (PyPI and local packages)

### 2. Smart Task Generation
- Analyzes the agent's tools and groups them by capability (web, file, shell, search)
- AI generates a concrete, safe test task that exercises the agent's actual tools
- Tasks always use real URLs and create files before reading them — no hallucinated paths

### 3. Static Analysis
- **Dependency Check** — Detects missing, installed, and local packages
- **Security Scan** — Identifies hardcoded credentials and potential leaks
- **Tool Detection** — Finds `@tool` decorators, external tools, tool imports
- **Issue Classification** — HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW severity with descriptions

### 4. Workspace Isolation
Each agent execution gets a sandboxed working directory:
```
norn_logs/workspace/
├── git-20260227-calendar-agent-run1/   ← output files land here
│   ├── result.txt
│   └── appointments.db
└── hook-my-pipeline-agent-a/
    └── report.md
```
The path is exposed as `NORN_WORKSPACE` so agents can reference it explicitly.

### 5. Runtime Monitoring
- **Step Analyzer** — Detects loops, drift, and inefficiency (deterministic, fast)
- **Quality Evaluator** — AI-powered relevance and security scoring via Amazon Nova Lite
- **Security Monitor** — Checks for data leaks, injections, unauthorized access

### 6. Session Evaluation
After task completion, deep analysis with Nova Lite:
- Task completion assessment with confidence score
- Per-tool usage analysis: was each tool used correctly?
- Decision-making pattern observations
- Efficiency explanation (actual steps vs expected)
- Actionable recommendations

### 7. Swarm Monitoring
When multiple agents share the same `swarm_id`, Norn groups them into a pipeline view:
- **Alignment score** (0–100%): Jaccard word-overlap between each agent's task and the first agent's — detects goal drift across the chain
- **Agent ordering**: agents are displayed in `swarm_order` sequence with visual connectors
- **Collective quality**: the pipeline's worst quality level is surfaced at the swarm level

| Alignment | Label | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 80% | Aligned | All agents working toward the same goal |
| 50–79% | Slight Drift | Minor topic divergence |
| < 50% | High Drift | Agents have diverged significantly from original intent |

### 8. Browser Audit *(optional)*
When agents visit URLs, Nova Act runs a shadow browser session to independently verify:
- The page content matches what the agent reported
- No prompt injection payloads are present in the page
- The agent's actions were legitimate and expected

Requires a Nova Act API key (early access): set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

## 🤖 Amazon Nova Models Used

Norn is built entirely on the Amazon Nova model family, with each model chosen for its strengths:

| Feature | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Task Generation** | Nova 2 Lite | Generates structured JSON test tasks tailored to each agent's tools |
| **Step Relevance Scoring** | Nova 2 Lite | Per-step relevance (0–100) evaluated in real time during execution |
| **Security Scoring** | Nova 2 Lite | Detects data exfiltration, prompt injection, and credential leaks per step |
| **Session Evaluation** | Nova 2 Lite | Deep post-run analysis: task completion, tool usage, decision patterns, efficiency |
| **Browser Audit** | Nova Act | Autonomous browser agent that independently visits URLs and detects prompt injection |

**Model IDs (configurable via `.env`):**
```
amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0   # All AI features: real-time scoring, task gen, session eval
Nova Act                  # Shadow browser verification (requires NOVA_ACT_API_KEY)
```

---

## 🔧 Integration Methods

Add Norn to your own Strands agent in one of four ways:

### 1. Manual Hook *(recommended — full dashboard integration)*
```python
from norn import NornHook
from strands import Agent

guard = NornHook(
    norn_url="http://localhost:8000",
    agent_name="My Agent",
    session_id="my-agent",          # Fixed ID — steps accumulate across restarts
)
agent = Agent(tools=[...], hooks=[guard])
agent("Your task")
```

That's it. Every tool call is now tracked in real time on the dashboard.

> **`session_id`** keeps steps from resetting on restart. Without it, each run
> creates a new timestamped session card. Use a fixed slug (e.g. `"my-agent"`)
> to persist the session across restarts.

### 2. Proxy Wrapper *(local logging only)*
```python
from norn.proxy import MonitoredAgent

agent = MonitoredAgent(model=model, tools=tools)
agent("Your task")
```

> Sessions are saved to `norn_logs/` but **not** pushed to the dashboard.
> Use **Manual Hook** with `norn_url` for dashboard visibility.

### 3. Global Monitoring *(local logging only)*
```python
from norn.proxy import enable_global_monitoring

enable_global_monitoring()
# All Agent instances are now monitored automatically
```

> Sessions are saved locally. Use **Manual Hook** for dashboard integration.

### 4. Environment Variable (Zero Code) *(local logging only)*
```bash
export NORN_AUTO_ENABLE=true
python your_agent.py
```

> Sessions are saved locally. Use **Manual Hook** for dashboard integration.

### 5. Multi-Agent Swarm
Group multiple agents into a monitored pipeline with `swarm_id`:

```python
from norn import NornHook
from strands import Agent

# Agent 1 — Researcher
hook_a = NornHook(
    norn_url="http://localhost:8000",
    agent_name="Researcher",
    swarm_id="research-pipeline",
    swarm_order=1,
)
agent_a = Agent(tools=[web_search, ...], hooks=[hook_a])
result_a = agent_a("Find recent AI safety research trends")

# Agent 2 — Writer (receives output from Agent 1)
hook_b = NornHook(
    norn_url="http://localhost:8000",
    agent_name="Writer",
    swarm_id="research-pipeline",
    swarm_order=2,
)
agent_b = Agent(tools=[file_write, ...], hooks=[hook_b])
agent_b(f"Write a report based on: {result_a}")
```

Both sessions appear together under **Swarm Monitor** in the dashboard, with an alignment score showing how closely Agent 2's task stayed on topic.
