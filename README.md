## 🎯 The Problem

AI agents are complex and unpredictable:
- Get stuck in infinite loops
- Drift away from their task
- Have missing dependencies or tools
- Leak sensitive data
- Execute malicious commands
- Hallucinate results

You need to test, analyze, and monitor them before and during execution.

---

## 💡 The Solution

PhantomGuard provides a complete platform for agent testing and monitoring:

### 1. Import & Analyze
Import agents from GitHub or ZIP files. PhantomGuard automatically:
- Discovers tools, functions, and dependencies
- Detects missing packages and installs them
- Identifies potential issues (security, credentials, missing tools)
- Generates a smart test task tailored to the agent's actual capabilities

### 2. Run & Monitor
Execute agents directly from the dashboard with real-time monitoring:
- Live WebSocket updates during execution
- Step-by-step tool call tracking with relevance and security scoring
- Issue detection and alerts
- Automatic loop and drift detection

### 3. Review & Improve
Comprehensive session reports with:
- Task completion analysis
- Efficiency and security scores
- Per-tool usage analysis (correct / incorrect / unnecessary)
- Agent decision-making observations
- AI-powered recommendations via Amazon Nova

### 4. Browser Audit *(requires Nova Act API key)*
Shadow browser verification powered by Nova Act:
- Automatically visits URLs accessed by agents
- Verifies that web content matches expected results
- Detects prompt injection attacks embedded in web pages
- Enable: `pip install -e ".[browser]"` + set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` in `.env`

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/hashtagemy/phantomguard.git
cd phantomguard

# Install backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[api]"

# Install frontend
cd phantomguard-dashboard && npm install && cd ..

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env  # Add your AWS credentials

# Start backend (terminal 1)
python -m phantomguard.api

# Start dashboard (terminal 2)
cd phantomguard-dashboard && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** — the dashboard will be live.

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 🎨 Dashboard

Modern React dashboard with real-time monitoring:

- **Agent Management** — Import from GitHub or ZIP, view all registered agents
- **Code Analysis** — Automatic discovery of tools, functions, and dependencies
- **Smart Task Generation** — AI-generated test tasks based on each agent's actual tools
- **Dependency Management** — Auto-install missing packages (PyPI and local)
- **Real-Time Monitoring** — WebSocket-based live updates during execution
- **Session History** — View all past executions with detailed reports
- **Issue Detection** — Security, quality, and dependency issues highlighted
- **Browser Audit** — Nova Act shadow verification for web-browsing agents (set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` to enable)
- **Configuration** — Adjust guard mode and thresholds from the UI

**Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite · FastAPI + Python 3.10+ · WebSocket

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Agent Import & Discovery
- Import agents from GitHub (with subfolder support) or ZIP files
- AST-based code analysis discovers tools, functions, dependencies, and entry points
- Automatic dependency installation (PyPI and local packages)

### 2. Smart Task Generation
- Analyzes the agent's tools and groups them by capability (web, file, shell, search)
- AI generates a concrete, safe test task that exercises the agent's actual tools
- Tasks always use real URLs and create files before reading them — no hallucinated paths

### 3. Static Analysis
- **Dependency Check** — Detects missing, installed, and local packages
- **Security Scan** — Identifies hardcoded credentials and potential leaks
- **Tool Detection** — Finds `@tool` decorators, external tools, tool imports
- **Issue Classification** — HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW severity with descriptions

### 4. Runtime Monitoring
- **Step Analyzer** — Detects loops, drift, and inefficiency (deterministic, fast)
- **Quality Evaluator** — AI-powered relevance and security scoring via Amazon Nova Micro
- **Security Monitor** — Checks for data leaks, injections, unauthorized access

### 5. Session Evaluation
After task completion, deep analysis with Nova Lite:
- Task completion assessment with confidence score
- Per-tool usage analysis: was each tool used correctly?
- Decision-making pattern observations
- Efficiency explanation (actual steps vs expected)
- Actionable recommendations

### 6. Browser Audit *(optional)*
When agents visit URLs, Nova Act runs a shadow browser session to independently verify:
- The page content matches what the agent reported
- No prompt injection payloads are present in the page
- The agent's actions were legitimate and expected

Requires a Nova Act API key (early access): set `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

## 🤖 Amazon Nova Models Used

PhantomGuard is built entirely on the Amazon Nova model family, with each model chosen for its strengths:

| Feature | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Task Generation** | Nova 2 Lite | Generates structured JSON test tasks tailored to each agent's tools |
| **Step Relevance Scoring** | Nova 2 Lite | Per-step relevance (0–100) evaluated in real time during execution |
| **Security Scoring** | Nova 2 Lite | Detects data exfiltration, prompt injection, and credential leaks per step |
| **Session Evaluation** | Nova 2 Lite | Deep post-run analysis: task completion, tool usage, decision patterns, efficiency |
| **Browser Audit** | Nova Act | Autonomous browser agent that independently visits URLs and detects prompt injection |

**Model IDs (configurable via `.env`):**
```
amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0   # All AI features: real-time scoring, task gen, session eval
Nova Act                  # Shadow browser verification (requires NOVA_ACT_API_KEY)
```

## 🔧 Integration Methods

Add PhantomGuard to your own Strands agent in one of four ways:

### 1. Manual Hook
```python
from phantomguard import PhantomGuardHook
from strands import Agent

guard = PhantomGuardHook(task="Your task description")
agent = Agent(tools=[...], hooks=[guard])
agent("Your task description")
```

### 2. Proxy Wrapper
```python
from phantomguard.proxy import MonitoredAgent

agent = MonitoredAgent(model=model, tools=tools, task="Your task description")
agent("Your task description")
```

### 3. Global Monitoring
```python
from phantomguard.proxy import enable_global_monitoring

enable_global_monitoring()
# All Agent instances are now monitored automatically
```

### 4. Environment Variable (Zero Code)
```bash
export PHANTOMGUARD_AUTO_ENABLE=true
python your_agent.py
```
