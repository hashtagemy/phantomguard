        "text": "I've completed the research project on recent developments in quantum computing. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Research Project Summary: Quantum Computing Developments (2025-2026)\n\n### Sources Investigated:\n1. **Google News** - Aggregated recent quantum computing news\n2. **IBM Quantum** - Official company announcements and roadmap\n3. **Google Quantum AI** - Willow chip and Quantum Echoes breakthrough\n4. **Microsoft Research** - Quantum computing research publications\n5. **arXiv** - 315+ recent quantum physics research papers\n\n### Key Findings:\n\n#### 🔬 **Major Hardware Breakthroughs**\n| Company | Development | Significance |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Google** | Willow Chip + Quantum Echoes | First verifiable quantum advantage |\n| **IBM** | Nighthawk Processor | Higher-connectivity, 100+ qubit fleet |\n| **Microsoft** | Topoconductor & Topological QPU | New path to fault-tolerant qubits |\n| **IQM** | 300-qubit computer for Finland | European quantum advancement |\n\n#### 📈 **Critical Trends for 2025-2026**\n- **Error Correction Focus**: Transition from physical to logical qubits\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Industry-wide priority for reliable quantum computing\n- **Multiple Tech Approaches**: Superconducting, topological, trapped ions, photonic, neutral atoms\n- **Cloud Access Expansion**: IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq, Azure Quantum\n\n#### 💰 **Market & Policy**\n- UN declared 2025 as **International Year of Quantum Science**\n- **$2.5 Billion** US Department of Energy Quantum Leadership Act\n- **76+ major companies** in the quantum computing space\n- **5,000+ research papers** using IBM quantum hardware\n\n#### ⚠️ **Key Challenges**\n1. Decoherence and maintaining quantum states\n2. Reducing error rates for complex computations\n3. Scaling to thousands of high-quality qubits\n4. Cost reduction for broader adoption\n5. Building quantum workforce talent\n\n### Deliverables Created:\n- ✅ **Full Research Report**: `quantum_computing_research_report_2026.md` (saved locally)\n- ⚠️ **Knowledge Base Storage**: Failed - no knowledge base ID configured\n\n### Note on Knowledge Base:\nThe research could not be stored in the Bedrock Knowledge Base because the `STRANDS_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID` environment variable is not configured. To enable knowledge base storage, set this environment variable with a valid AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base ID.\n\n---\n\nThe research demonstrates that quantum computing is at an exciting inflection point, with major players achieving genuine breakthroughs in error correction and demonstrating verifiable quantum advantage for the first time."
